As a practical exercise in distributed version control and to refresh my understanding of Git and remote collaboration workflows, I cloned this portfolio repository onto a different machine with a fresh VSCode setup (distinct from the original development environment). I then executed a complete Git workflow: pulling the latest changes, making local modifications, committing them and pushing the updates back to the same remote repository.

This process was completed without any **merge conflicts or synchronization issues**, demonstrating my ability to manage Git-based version control effectively across multiple environments while maintaining a clean and consistent commit history in a shared codebase. This hands-on exercise solidify my understanding of Git workflows in a real-world project context.
